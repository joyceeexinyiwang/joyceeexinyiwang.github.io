# My name is Joyce Wang (王心怡).

I am an adisciplinary researcher and maker interested in media, culture, and computational methods. 

I anchor my work in people. Using technology, research, and artistic expression, I aspire to create meaningful gatherings of people and help them understand each others' stories while challenging each others' storytelling.

Currently, I am studying computer science and design for the theater at Carnegie Mellon University.
