# My name is Joyce Wang (王心怡).

I am a creative technologist, theater lover, and adisciplinary researcher. I anchor my work in its relation to people, and I strive to tell stories that delight and inspire. At a moment, I am studying Computer Science and Drama at Carnegie Mellon University.

I was born and raised in Beijing. When I was 15, I came to the US to attend Phillips Academy, where I developed a keen interest in global culture and history. Since 2015, I have been studying at Carnegie Mellon University as part of an interdisciplinary program called [B.C.S.A](http://www.flong.com/blog/2017/the-rigor-of-cmus-bcsa-degree/), taking classes across the School of Computer Science and the School of Drama. I have worked on the [media design team](/theater/2017/11/05/Sock.html) for several theater productions, taught intro-level programming, made art, and  directed an [multi-media experimental performance piece](/theater/2017/12/10/Translations.html). For my first internship, I worked at Microsoft as a software engineer within the marketplace service division. Most recently, I spent an incredible summer at [Disney research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/), prototyping interfaces for writers and artists to create personable AI.

At the moment (fall 2018), I am working on my computer science [senior honors thesis](https://github.com/joyceeexinyiwang/SocietalComputing) with [Prof. Kathleen Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html), decoding patterns of journalistic practices and news consumption on Twitter using social network analysis.

After graduation, I will be staying at CMU for one extra year on the [Fifth Year Scholarship](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/fifth/index.html), which would fund me to design and organize interdisciplinary programs for undergraduate students.

I adore reading, museums, new environments, and being active. My family and friends are the most important part of my life. Having been far from home for a long time, and often finding myself in between different cultural and intellectual spaces, I try to find a balance between different parts of my identity and live as honestly as I can.
