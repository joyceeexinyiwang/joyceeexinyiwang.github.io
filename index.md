My name is Joyce Wang. 我叫王心怡。

born and raised in Beijing

I attended Phillips Academy at MA. did my first research project ever on the education of migrant children in mainland China.

Came to Pittsburgh to attend Carnegie Mellon University. I am in an interdisciplinary program between the School of Computer Science and the School of Drama. I love it because it has truly allowed me to go where my curiosity leads and pursue what I believe to be meaningful. 

worked on the media design team for theater productions
made media arts
directed a show

worked at Microsoft as a software engineer.

currently working on thesis
