# My name is Joyce Wang (王心怡).

I am a creative technologist and a theater maker. I anchor my work in its relation to people, and I strive to tell stories that delight and inspire. As someone who often finds herself across different cultural and intellectual spaces, I believe in the power of being authentic and synthesizing ideas generated from different perspectives and mindsets.

Currently, I am studying computer science and drama at Carnegie Mellon University.
