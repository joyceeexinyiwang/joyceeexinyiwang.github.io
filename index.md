我叫王心怡。 My name is Wang Xin Yi, but you may call me Joyce. I am a student and aspiring researcher interested in media, culture, and computational methods. 

I was born and raised in Beijing. When I was 15, I came to the US to attend Phillips Academy, where I developed a keen interest in global culture and history. Since 2015, I have been an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am in an interdisciplinary program called [B.C.S.A](https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bcsaprogram.html), which is between the School of Computer Science and the School of Drama. I love it because it has allowed me to go where my curiosity leads and pursue what I believe to be meaningful. I have enjoyed taking classes in computer science, fine art, English, and philosophy. I have worked on the [media design team](/theater/2017/11/05/Sock.html) for several theater productions, taught intro-level programming, made art, and  directed my own [experimental performance piece about language and empathy](/theater/2017/12/10/Translations.html). For my first internship, I worked at Microsoft as a software engineer within the marketplace service division. Most recently, I spent an incredible summer at [Disney research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) as a lab associate under Prof. Mubbasir Kapadia, researching on authoring interfaces for embodied conversational agents and thinking creatively about AI. I met amazing PhD students, post-docs, and research scientists. The whole experience made me feel extra determined to pursue research in the next steps of my academic career.

At the moment (fall 2018), I am at CMU, taking CS+drama classes, designing for a show, and working on my [thesis in social computing](https://github.com/joyceeexinyiwang/SocietalComputing) with Prof. Kathleen Carley.

After graduation, I will be staying at CMU for an extra year on the [Fifth Year Scholarship](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/fifth/index.html), which would fund me to organize [workshops, games, and festivals](https://github.com/joyceeexinyiwang/FYS) for the goal of disrupting discipline-based networks in the CMU community.

I adore museums, music, new environments, and being active. My family and friends are the most important part of my life. Having been far from home for a long time, and occasionally feeling a bit foreign wherever I am, I try to find a balance between the different parts of my identity and live as honestly as I can.
