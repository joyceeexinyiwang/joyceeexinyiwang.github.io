My name is Joyce Wang. 我叫王心怡。I am an aspiring researcher interested in media, culture, and computational methods. 

I was born and raised in Beijing in 1996. When I was 15 years old, I came to the US to attend Phillips Academy in Massachusetts. During my boarding school years, I developed a keen interest in global culture and history. I completed my first research project, which was on the education of migrant children in mainland China. Since 2015, I have been an undergraduate student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I am in an interdisciplinary program called [B.C.S.A](https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/bcsaprogram.html) between the School of Computer Science and the School of Drama. I love it because it has truly allowed me to go where my curiosity leads and pursue what I believe to be meaningful. Specifically, I have enjoyed taking classes in computer science, fine art, English, and philosophy. I have worked on the media design team for several theater productions, created media art sketches, and  directed my own experimental performance piece about language and empathy. During one summer, I worked for Microsoft as a software engineer within the marketplace service division. In the most recent summer, I worked at [Disney research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) as a lab associate under Prof. Mubbasir Kapadia. My research involved thinking creatively about AI and designing authoring interfaces for embodied conversational agents. I had the most fun, healthy, and inspiring time--I met amazing PhD students, post-docs, and research scientists, who made me feel extra determined to pursue research in the next steps of my academic career.

At the moment (fall 2018), I am at CMU, taking CS+drama classes, designing for a show, and working on my thesis in social computing.

After graduation, I will be staying at CMU for an extra year on the [Fifth Year Scholarship](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/fifth/index.html), which would fund me to organize workshops, games, and festivals for the goal of disrupting discipline-based networks in the CMU community.

I adore museums, music, new environments, being active, and spending time with family and friends. I have been away from Beijing for a long time, and sometimes I do feel a bit foreign when I am back. However, I am grateful for all the experiences of feeling at home or not, because they have shaped who I am. It has been a wild ride building bridges and seeing beauty from more than one side.
