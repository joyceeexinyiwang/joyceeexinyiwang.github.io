我叫王心怡。 My name is Wang Xin Yi, but you may call me Joyce. I am an adisciplinary researcher and theater maker passionate about media, culture, and computational methods. 

I was born and raised in Beijing. When I was 15, I came to the US to attend Phillips Academy, where I developed a keen interest in global culture and history. Since 2015, I have been studying at Carnegie Mellon University as part of an interdisciplinary program called [B.C.S.A](http://www.flong.com/blog/2017/the-rigor-of-cmus-bcsa-degree/), taking classes across the School of Computer Science and the School of Drama. I have worked on the [media design team](/theater/2017/11/05/Sock.html) for several theater productions, taught intro-level programming, made art, and  directed an [multi-media experimental performance piece](/theater/2017/12/10/Translations.html). For my first internship, I worked at Microsoft as a software engineer within the marketplace service division. Most recently, I spent an incredible summer at [Disney research](https://www.disneyresearch.com/) as a lab associate under [Prof. Mubbasir Kapadia](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mk1353/), researching on authoring interfaces for intelligent virtual characters and thinking creatively about AI.

At the moment (fall 2018), I am working on my computer science [senior honors thesis](https://github.com/joyceeexinyiwang/SocietalComputing) with [Prof. Kathleen Carley](http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/bios/carley/carley.html), exploring patterns of journalistic practices on Twitter using social network analysis.

After graduation, I will be staying at CMU for an extra year on the [Fifth Year Scholarship](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/dean/fifth/index.html), which would fund me to organize [workshops, games, and festivals](https://github.com/joyceeexinyiwang/FYS) for the goal of disrupting discipline-based networks in the CMU community.

I adore museums, music, new environments, and being active. My family and friends are the most important part of my life. Having been far from home for a long time, and occasionally feeling a bit foreign wherever I am, I try to find a balance between different parts of my identity and live as honestly as I can.
