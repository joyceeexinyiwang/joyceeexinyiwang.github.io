**"How to Put On a Sock"** was an experimental theatrical performance that explored sex education and abortion policy across the United States today. As media designers, we created two worlds in parallel on stage: a high school sex-ed class, and the memories of two American teenagers. Throughout the play, the audience participated through anonymous, text-in **polling**. They were asked about their personal experience with and opinions on sex education and abortion. The polls, whose results were displayed in real-time, enhanced the relationship between each audience member, highlighting the similarities and differences in their person backgrounds and values within the play's larger discussion of national issues.
